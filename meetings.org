*** Computing/Tracking Q (log-likelihood)
**** Plotting/Logging
**** Use p(X) instead
*** Expectation computation + maximization

** 2019-03-12, 8.30 AM
*** Mail Meeting Philipp, 2019-03-18
*** Debugging recursion/scaling factors

*** DONE Move meeting with Philipp by one week → 2019-03-28
    CLOSED: [2019-04-02 Di 08:35]
*** DONE Bug fixing: Scaling factors
    CLOSED: [2019-04-02 Di 08:36]
**** Summary of computational steps
**** α, β, γ, ξ computation works
**** \hat{α} to α rescaling works
**** \hat{β} to β rescaling works
**** p(X) consistent with non-scaled result
**** Equations in Bishop correct → a factor is missing in either \hat{α} or \hat{β}
*** DONE New bug: ξ from rescaled quantities NOT consistent with result from unscaled quantities 
    CLOSED: [2019-04-02 Di 08:36]
***** DONE Check both computations
      CLOSED: [2019-04-02 Di 08:35]
